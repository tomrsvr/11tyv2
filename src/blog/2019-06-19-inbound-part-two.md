*Monthly roundup of news and development updates from Japan Travel, as well as insights into some of the work we do.*

## How we did in May

### Sky Intrigue for #Hilton100

We joined forces with Hilton to sell a special, exclusive stay plan in celebration of their 100th anniversary on 31st May— with bespoke luxury on offer courtesy of Conrad’s superior stays and travel by supercar and private charter aircraft. More about the announcement [here](https://ja.japantravel.com/static/press/%E3%80%90%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%80%91%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E3%80%8C%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AB%E3%82%A4%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B0%E3%80%8D.pdf) (Ja).

## Knowledge Base

We’re unveiling an upgrade of our support pages, for all site users to take advantage of. We call it the Knowledge Center.

Our guidance has come a long way since its humble beginnings.

Back in 2015, I took an early decision to do away with PDF documentation in favour of fluid HTML — the latter offers improved accessibility, mobile support, search-friendly qualities and — let’s face it — is just faster to update.

However our style guide never aged so well. It grew to cover a variety of admittedly non-style topics yet still admirably clinged to a single page format.

The new Help Center takes a user-centric approach to problem-solving by structuring support info around the type of users, their needs and their related goals.

Our hope is that it’s now much easier to find what you are looking for, and we expect new data points will help lead us there too.

Page interaction data will offer us a glimpse of what content is needed most, as well as what content performs well or even reveal potential pain points where guidance is failing to lead users to their intended goal. This gives us the confidence to make changes over time — backed by what the metrics tell us.

The new approach also allows us to pursue more long tail topics that should not only be useful to ambitious writers but also attract new members to the site.

As well as just getting things done, learning is a key theme for the Help Center. Users can find info that helps make their articles more compelling or better optimised for SEO.

In some cases, we tell you what we think works best, but we also blend in recommendations and links to other authoritative sites on certain topics too.

## Inbound News in May

### Reiwa Era defines Golden Week 2019

Emperor Akihito’s Heisei era drew to a close after 31 years, with Emperor Naruhito’s enthronement heralding the arrival of Japan’s Reiwa (令和) era. Timed with the celebrations, one additional public holiday was legislated for 2019, giving rise to a 10-day Golden Week holiday (successive public holidays).

Golden Week is something of a boon for the domestic travel industry thanks to a huge spike in demand for travel services. Unfortunately, it is something of a minefield for inbound travellers, with roads, airports and stations often packed, delays common, accommodation booked up and prices at peak levels.
