                    <h3 class="subtitle">Why this page?</h3>

                    <p>Although I primarily lead teams of creatives, I've realised I needed my own space to demonstrate my technical knowledge and personal brand. Secondly, I want to show how setting up a website does not involve huge upfront costs.</p>

                    <p>I initially had a custom WordPress back in 2014, which I initially shelved for two main reasons:</p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Learning PHP to the degree needed to develop a custom WordPress theme i.e. specialise solely in WordPress, did not necessarily appeal to me so I dug a hole setting up a templated yet heavily-customed site.</li>
                        <li>Secondly, the cost of hosting a website seemed harder to justify the less I found myself updating the site but also the negligible amount of data actually being hosted.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>I guess being within WordPress and not developing it created a self-imposed creative restriction I wrestled with.</p>

                    <p>Fast-forward to 2022 and it feels like the landscape for static-sites has evolved quite a bit—not to mention the spec for HTML and CSS. With the barriers to entry lower than ever to prospective coders, I realised I needed full control even with relatively straightforward needs.</p>
